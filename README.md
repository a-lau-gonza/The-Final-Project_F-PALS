# F-PALS: The Final Project
Our final project will be based on a machine learning algorithm for the F1 to find out: Who will win the season for drivers or constructors?

## Communication Protocols
* Meeting Times: 6:00PM - Whenever
  * Using Slack to figure out what specific days to meet up for working together
  * Use Zoom for audio and video meetings

## Segment 1: Roles
* __*SQUARE*__: Andrew
* __*TRIANGLE*__:
* __*CIRCLE*__:
* __*X*__:

## Segment 1: Notes
* using google colab, for multiple people to work on the code if necessary
* database? will look into how much data is already out there and how to organize the data
* SQL and Postgres may be useful
* Initial relevant variables: __drivers, constructors, DNFs__, __regulation (seasons of similar rules, *with this one we could focus entirely on 2017 - present*)__, tracks/track history with drivers/constructors, __weather (though most of the time it's dry and typically weather is the big shake up for significant differences from predicitions)__
