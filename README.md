# F-PALS: The Final Project
Selected Topic: Formula 1 The Premier International Racing Series
Our final project will be based on a machine learning algorithm for the F1 to find out: Who will win the season for drivers or constructors?
Reasons that we picked F1: We had an initial vote to see generally what we wanted to work on, most of us had sports in our possible topics. Sports was a widely noted genre due to the amount of data collected and available for the project. As for which sport we wanted to use, it came down to 2: American Football with the NFL, and Formula 1. At first we picked football as our topic as there was a majority vote due to popular interest. It is the most popular sport in America. However, we soon realized that though we had the data, the bracket system and the permutations it encompassed made wrapping our head around how we would code it for machine learning. So we took another look at the other option available, which was Formula 1. In this sport all 10 teams and 20 drivers all perform in each event.

## Segment 1: Roles
__*SQUARE*__: Andrew
__*TRIANGLE*__: Freddie
__*CIRCLE*__: Sean, Peter
__*X*__: Lanisha

## Segment 1: Notes
* using google colab, for multiple people to work on the code if necessary
* database? will look into how much data is already out there and how to organize the data
* SQL and Postgres may be useful
* Initial relevant variables: __drivers, constructors, DNFs__, __regulation (seasons of similar rules, *with this one we could focus entirely on 2017 - present*)__, tracks/track history with drivers/constructors, __weather (though most of the time it's dry and typically weather is the big shake up for significant differences from predicitions)__
